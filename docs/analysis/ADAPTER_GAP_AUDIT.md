# Adapter Gap Audit – December 2025

**Purpose:** Track the remaining ACB adapters/actions that still need to be ported to Oneiric so the “single cut-over” strategy stays on schedule. This audit should be refreshed whenever a new adapter lands or a dependency decision changes.

| Email fallback | `console` | Dev/test email | ⚠️ Legacy (ACB) | Docs Team | Decide whether to keep (useful for demos) or replace with structured logging recipe. |
| Storage extras | `filesystem.archive` | Package artifacts | ⚠️ On hold | Data Platform | Evaluate after serverless profile if archival storage still needed. |
| Identity | `cloudflare` | Token validation | ⚠️ On hold | Security | Auth0 already ported; Cloudflare only needed if FastBlocks requests it. |

## Actions

1. **Messaging bundle (SendGrid/Mailgun/Twilio):** share HTTP telemetry middleware, provide manifest snippets, and add CLI how-to in `docs/examples/LOCAL_CLI_DEMO.md`. See `docs/implementation/MESSAGING_AND_SCHEDULER_ADAPTER_PLAN.md` for deliverables, owners, and test expectations.
1. **Scheduler bundle (Cloud Tasks + Pub/Sub):** add adapters plus queue fixtures so DAG orchestration (WS-B) can rely on them. Details in the plan above.
1. **Docs:** cross-link this audit from `docs/implementation/SERVERLESS_AND_PARITY_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` §5 so the backlog stays visible.

## Priority Focus (Q1 2026)

| Workstream | Providers | Status | Owner | ETA/Notes |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Graph DB / Feature stores** | Neo4j (✅), ArangoDB (✅), DuckDB PGQ (✅) | ✅ Complete | Data Platform | All graph adapters landed Dec 2025; PGQ adapter documents in `GRAPH_ADAPTERS.md`. |
| **DNS/File transfer** | Cloudflare DNS, Route53, FTP/SFTP/SCP/HTTPS | ✅ Complete | Security/Infra | Cloudflare + Route53 DNS plus FTP/SFTP/SCP/HTTP download/HTTPS upload adapters landed; next evaluation focuses on optional transports (webpush, feature flags). |

Status and owners for each bucket should be updated here as soon as a concrete ETA or design note changes.

Update this file as soon as an adapter lands or gets deprioritized. It replaces scattered TODOs in historical plans and should be referenced in weekly stand-ups.\*\*\*
